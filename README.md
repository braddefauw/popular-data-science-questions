# popular-data-science-questions

In this scenario, I am working for a company that creates data science content, be it books, online articles, videos or interactive text-based platforms like Dataquest.

I'm tasked with figuring out what is best content to write about. Given the lack of instructions there's some leeway in what "best" means here.

Since I'm passionate about helping people learn, I decide to scour the internet in search for the answer to the question "What is it that people want to learn about in data science?" (as opposed to determining the most profitable content, for instance).

Thinking back to my experience when I first started learning programming, it occured to me that if I wanted to figure out what programming content to write, I could consult [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (a question and answer website about programming) and see what kind of content is more popular.

I decided to investigate Stack Overflow a little more and find out that it is part of a question and answer website network called [Stack Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange).

Stack Exchange hosts sites on a multitude of fields and subjects, including mathematics, physics, philosophy, and [data science](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/)!

Stack Exchange employs a reputation award system for its questions and answers. Each post — each question/answer — is a post that is subject to upvotes and downvotes. This ensures that good posts are easily identifiable.

The fact that DSSE is a data science dedicated site (contrarily to the others), coupled with it having a lot of unanswered questions, makes it an ideal candidate for this investigation. DSSE will be the focus of this guided project.
